| 206 | [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/) | Easy       |

---
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

---

## Example 1

<pre>
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
</pre>

---

## Example 2

<pre>
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
</pre>

---

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

**Follow up**: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
